# SwiftMASShortcut

This is a port to Swift of Vadim Shpakovski's very useful MASShortcut. 
https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut

I consider Vadim Shpakovski to have copyright of this project too. I ported it, pretty much line by line. 
If you need something that has been widely tested you should probably stick with the original Obj-C version.
